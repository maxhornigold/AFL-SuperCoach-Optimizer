# AFL-SuperCoach-Optimizer
Mixed Integer Programming models to optimize SuperCoach scores.


Contains three different Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) models to optimize AFL SuperCoach scores.

These models include an optimal model, a budget model, and a ghost model.

The optimal model maximises the best possible score using the regular game rules.

The budget model minimises the starting budget which will still make it possible to win the competition.

The ghost model maximises the total season score given that no changes to the initial team is made.

Two datasets are included which contain data for the 2018 and 2021.
